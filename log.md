# Day 01 - Introduction to Cloud Computing

#### Month: Dec 12, 2020

**Focus**: The learning focuses on understanding the Cloud Computing ecosystem and as well as its on-demand availability, scalability, and elasticity.

**Progress**:
- Types of Cloud Computing
- Deployment Models 
- Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Amazon Web Services AWS Overview

**Thoughts**: Today, I have learned the basic concepts about Cloud Computing and how it is useful in this 21st century.
In addition, Cloud Computing uses computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

# Day 04 - Foundational and Compute Service

#### Month: Dec 15, 2020

**Focus**: The learning was focused on Lambda function and its parameters. I have put careful consideration on how to start and stop the instance. I even played around with API gateway that called the lambda function to bring the intance up/down.



**Progress**:
- Learn the basic of Lambda
- Review the concepts of event source downstream resources, and log stream
- Create Lambda function using the Python runtime in the editor
- Creaye IAM roles to give not only Lambda access to EC2 but also CloudWatch
- Code the lambda function to start/stop an EC2 instance
- Playing around with environment variables


**Thoughts**: Today, it was all about Lambda function. I have noticed that AWS Lambda  and API Gateway go hand in hand. Needless to say, they are the cores of Serverless Architecture.

# Day 05 - AWS Management

#### Month: Dec 16, 2020

**Focus**: Today the learning aimed to better understand the AWS terminal meaning the AWS Command Line (CLI) Interface.



**Progress**:
- Getting the Raspberry Pi up and running with no GUI installed
- Install the AWS CLI SDK
- Getting familiar with the AWS CLI commands

# Day 06 - Storage & Content Delivery

#### Month: Dec 17, 2020

**Focus**: Among AWS services I have been working on today, I can state the following: S3 for storage and web hosting, DynamoDB for No SQL DB, RDS which is short for Relational Database Service, and CloudFront to speed up static and dynamic web content delivery. 



**Progress**:
- Create a NoSQL database using DynamoDB
- Create a PostgreSQL database instance using RDS
- Connect and query the databases
- Create a S3 bucket and upload a simple web site to the bucket
- Create a CloudFront distribution for the website


**Thoughts**: The beauty of a network (LAN/WAN) is the connection of the devices. Moreover, the  interaction among AWS services makes hands-on funnier, as far as I'm concerned.

**Progress**:
- Create an IAM policy



**Thoughts**: I have learned the model of shared security which means AWS is responsible for the "Security of the Cloud" while customers are responsible for "Security in the Cloud."

- Save and deploy a CloudFormation stack
- View S3 Bucket created by CloudFormation Stack



**Thoughts**: I have learned not only the basics but also the difference between the following AWS services: CloudTrail, Cloudwatch, and CloudFormation. 
- With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. 
- With CloudWatch, you collect and track metrics, monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources. 
- With CloudFormation, you can describe your desired resources and their dependencies to launch and configure them together as a stack.

# Day 10 - AWS Management

#### Month: Dec 21, 2020

**Focus**: Today it was all ablout AWS CLI which stands for Command Line Interface.

 

**Progress**:
- Getting the raspberry pi up and running (no GUI)
- Install the AWS CLI SDK
- Configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Playing around with the AWS CLI commands



**Thoughts**: It is a pain in the neck when not knowing which commands to use to accomplish some tasks. Becoming familiar with the CLI documention is a plus if I want to save tiime in the future.

# Day 11 - Cloud Fundamentals Project 
## Deploy Static Website on AWS

#### Month: Dec 22, 2020

**Focus**: Today the lesson focused on hosting and deploying a Static Website on AWS. 

 

**Progress**:
- Create an S3 bucket and secures it using IAM Policy
- Create an A record for the website using Route53
- Distribute the web site via CloudFront



**Thoughts**: As I'm getting deeper in AWS best practices, security is at the heart of all AWS core services. Simply said, IAM policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on what AWS resources. On the other hand, S3 bucket policies are attached only to S3 buckets.

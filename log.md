# Day 01 - Introduction to Cloud Computing

#### Month: Dec 12, 2020

**Focus**: The learning focuses on understanding the Cloud Computing ecosystem and as well as its on-demand availability, scalability, and elasticity.

**Progress**:
- Types of Cloud Computing
- Deployment Models 
- Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Amazon Web Services AWS Overview

**Thoughts**: Today, I have learned the basic concepts about Cloud Computing and how it is useful in this 21st century.
In addition, Cloud Computing uses computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

# Day 03 - Foundational and Compute Service

#### Month: Dec 14, 2020

**Focus**: Today, the learning lesson emphasized compute, storage, auto scaling and load balancing.

**Progress**:

- EC2-Basics:
	Learned how to create EC2 instance
	Associate the instance with a Security Group (SG) allowing SSH traffic from any IP
	Create a snapshot of the EBS volume attached to the EC2 Instance
	Create an AMI using the snapshot
	Create a new instance using the AMI

- Storage:

	Learn about the different storage class
	Create an EBS volume and attack it to instance
	Create an EFS filesystem and mount it to instance

- S3 and IAM Role:

	Create an S3 bucket
	Create IAM Role with EC2 Service
	Attach AmazonS3FullAccess to policy
	Attach role when creating launch configuration

- Auto scaling and Load Balancing

	Create launch configuration 
	Create autoscaling group using the launch configuration
	Create target groups
	Create load balancer and have load balancer serves traffic to the instance
	Verify you can see webapp from your browser


**Thoughts**: "Learning by Doing" is nothing esle than hands-on. I have realized that the best way to learn and gain experience in I. T. field is through hands-on.
